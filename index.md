I’m a second-year Ph.D student in the [Soil Fertility](https://agro.au.dk/en/research/research-sections/soil-fertility) section at [Department of Agroecology](https://agro.au.dk/en), advised by [Jørgen Eriksen](https://agro.au.dk/en/about-the-department/contact-agroecology/employees/show/person/jorgen.eriksen@agro.au.dk) and [Christian Dold](https://www.au.dk/c.dold@agro.au.dk). My research area is carbon and nitrogen cycle. My current focus is greenhouse gases from agriculture system.

Use #bibitem_Venue_Key to refer to "Venue:Key".

It is possible to have multiple BibTeX blocks, which will be rendered independently. For example, you might want to have one block for each of "Publications", "Pre-prints", and "Manuscripts".

title = "Increased N2O emissions by the soil nematode community cannot be fully explained by enhanced mineral N availability",
abstract = "Soil nematodes are the most abundant soil fauna, with a potential great impact on soil N mineralization via interaction with soil microorganisms. As a consequence, nematodes likely also influence soil N2O production and emission but the very few studies on this matter were carried out in simplified setups with single nematode species and in (highly) disturbed soil conditions. Here we measured soil N2O emissions in a 74-day incubation experiment in the presence or absence of the entire soil nematode community with minimal disturbance of the soil microbial community and soil nutrients. This was e.g. evidenced by readily recovery of nitrifiers after the mild and selective sterilization and soil powder inoculation. N2O emissions increased in the presence of nematodes, varying between soils +747.7 % in a loamy sand, +55.8 % in a loam, and +51.9 % in a silt loam cropland topsoil, in line with nematode abundance in these soils. In particular, the loamy sand soil showed an atypical N2O emission peak at the time of high nematode abundance. Soil nematodes also increased net N mineralization by +8.4, +6.8 and +4.75 %, in these respective soils and to a smaller extent C mineralization as well. The extra soil nitrate buildup and the overall net stimulation of N mineralization by nematodes could not or just slightly explain the observed increased N2O emission. This research revealed the important role of soil nematodes in regulating N2O emission, and further stresses the need to consider the change in community composition and activity of denitrifiers, and connectivity of soil pores, rather than the stimulation of N mineralization as potential explanations for this role of nematodes.",
